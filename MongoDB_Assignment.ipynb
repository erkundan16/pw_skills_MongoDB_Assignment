    "Q1. What is MongoDB? Explain non-relational databases in short. In which scenarios it is preferred to use MongoDB over SQL databases?\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB is a document-oriented NoSQL database system that provides high scalability, flexibility, and performance. Unlike standard relational databases, MongoDB stores data in a JSON document structure form. Non-relational databases, also known as NoSQL databases, do not depend on a fixed schema, allowing for easier handling of unstructured data⁴³. They are ideal for handling large volumes of data and are highly efficient in distributed environments. MongoDB may be a better choice if you are working on a project that requires handling large volumes of unstructured data or demands high scalability."

    "\n",
    "MongoDB offers many features:\n",
    "Document Model: MongoDB's document model is simple for developers to learn and use, while still providing all the capabilities needed to meet the most complex requirements at any scale.\n",
    "Sharding: Sharding is the process of splitting larger datasets across multiple distributed instances, or “shards.” When applied to particularly large datasets, sharding helps the database distribute and better execute what might otherwise be problematic and cumbersome queries.\n",
    "High Availability: MongoDB is a distributed database at its core, so high availability, horizontal scaling, and geographic distribution are built in and easy to use.\n",
    "Ad hoc queries, indexing, and real-time aggregation**: These provide powerful ways to access and analyze your data."
